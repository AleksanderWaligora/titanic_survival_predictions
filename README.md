A project based on data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic). The goal was to create predictive model that 
would predict if passanger would survive Sinking of the Titanic.

Files:

main.ipynb - file containing data prepartaion and training models

predicted_values - file containing predictions made by models trained by each ML algorithm.

titanic-survival_model.pkl - file containing model with best training accuracy

train.csv, test.csv - data from kaggle
